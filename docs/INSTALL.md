## Installation ##

### Install prerequisite software ###

This software depends on several other software packages. If you wish to compile from source,
also a number of development packages are needed. The names of the packages depend on your linux
distribution.

The below software list may be incomplete or may contain no longer needed packages.
Please open a ticket if you discover mistakes

Some of these packages are provided by rpmfusion, which can be installed using the instructions at
<https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration>


In addition, some python code needs to be installed using "sudo pip3 install &lt;PACKAGE&gt;";
at least the following packages are needed:

```
sudo pip3 install mpl_scatter_density
```

And some bugs need to be fixed by upgrading python3-matplotlib-wx to at least version 3.5.2:
```
sudo dnf update --enablerepo=updates-testing python3-matplotlib-wx
```


#### Debian ####

To install neumodvb in a Debian distro (Ubuntu, Linux Mint), first ensure that you are running a
recent version:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update
```

Then  install pre-requisite software:

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install clang-${llvmVersion}
sudo apt remove  clang
sudo ln -fs /usr/bin/clang-14  /usr/bin/clang
sudo ln -fs /usr/bin/clang++-14  /usr/bin/clang++
```

In addition, some python code needs to be installed using "sudo pip3 install &lt;PACKAGE&gt;";
at least the following packages are needed:

```
sudo pip3 regex mpl_scatter_density
```

### Download and compile neumodvb ###

The software can be downloaded as follows

```
    cd ~/
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/deeptho/neumodvb
```

Next, build NeumoDVB as follows:

```
    cd ~/neumodvb
    mkdir build
    mkdir build_ext
    cd ~/neumodvb/build
    cmake ..
    make -j8
```
In case of problems, first check for missing pre-requisite software. For some of the pre-requisite
software, fairly recent versions are needed.


For troubleshooting, the following information may be useful:

* Some of the source code being compiled is generated by a python script `src/neumodb/neumodb.py`,
  which takes its input from configuration files `dbdefs.py` located in `src/neumodb/chdb`, and similar
  directories. The resulting code is placed in `build/src/neumodb/chdb` and similar places
* To speed up compilation, some C++ headers are pre-compiled. Usually this works fine, but in some
  cases, after making changes to header files, the precompiled headers become out of date and
  need to be rebuild, Usually  this will be clear from  compiler errors, but in rare cases, the
  result will be worse: neumoDVB will compile and then crash in strange ways.  When this happens,
  remove all  files under `/build`, run `cmake ..` again in the build directory.

  Alternatively, modify the CMakeList.txt files to remove header pre-compilation
* That being said, the normal and fastest way of recompiling after making changes to sources -- which should work
  in most cases -- is simply as follows:

````
    cd ~/neumodvb/build;
    make -j`nproc`
````

* In any case, if your distribution uses `ccache`, compilation will be much faster the second time around,
  even after you clear `build/` completely.
* NeumoDVB contains copies of some external software packages, some of which have been modified.
 * Specifically, the database code `lmdb` (renamed to `neumolmdb` to avoid confusion with any existing lmdb
  on your system) contains a few small, but crucial changes compared to the source (e.g., related to setting the
  `FD_CLOEXEC` flag.
 * The `wxsvg` library (renamed to `neumowxsvg`) has been more heavily modified. The modifications
  consist of added code to allow for efficient embedded of the mpv video player.


After NeumoDVB has been built successfully, you can install it if you wish. Installation is optional:
you also run the software directly from the build tree. This makes it easier to debug problems.

```
    cd ~/neumodvb/build
    sudo make install
```
For packaging purposes, commands like ' make install DESTDIR=/tmp/temporary_location` also work fine.


### Install blindscan drivers ###

neumoDVB can work with the regular linuxDVB drivers and supports all cards supported by these drivers.

If you own a supported card, it is best to install the neumo blindscan kernel drivers.
These drivers are available at
[https://github.com/deeptho/blindscan](https://github.com/deeptho/blindscan).

Without these drivers, features like blindscan and spectral analysis will not work.
neumoDVB has not been tested with the regular kernel drivers. Crashes may occur if you try
to use unsupported features. These are bugs. Report them on the issue tracker.
